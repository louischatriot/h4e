h4e
===

**IMPORTANT: this library is not maintained anymore, please don't submit anymore pull requests except for bugfixes**

Hogan for Express 3.x (should work with Express 2.x too but I haven't tested it yet), with intelligent support for partials and layouts.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install h4e      # Install locally
$ npm install -g h4e   # Install globally
```

You can also add it to your `package.json`, the latest version is `0.3.0`. Here is the <a target="_blank" href="https://npmjs.org/package/h4e">npm page</a>.

## Testing

Install the dev dependencies, then `make test`. Uses <a target="_blank" href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">Mocha</a>.


## Usage
### Within Express

If you have the typical setup with your main module in `.`, your Mustache templates for the website in `./templates/website` 
and maybe those for a forum in `./templates/forum`, you have a choice:  
* **The super easy install** where h4e sets itself up to be Express' rendering engine (see first block in code below)
* **The easy install** where h4e compiles the templates and lets you link to Express as you're used to (second block)

```javascript
// #1: SUPER EASY INSTALL
// h4e takes care of all the configuration
var h4e = require('h4e')
  , express = require('express')
  , app = express();

h4e.setup({ app: app   // Give it your Express app so that it handles all the configuration

          , extension: 'mustache'   // Tell h4e all your templates end in '.mustache'
                                    // and you don't want to type it everytime

          , baseDir: 'templates'    // All your templates are in this directory or its descendants
                                    // Say it here and never type it again, h4e will know where to look

          , toCompile: ['website', 'forum'] });   // The subdirectories of baseDir where your templates
                                                  // really are. Tell h4e to compile them so you
                                                  // can use them
// Your're done!


// #2 EASY INSTALL
// Important, make sure that the extension and baseDir parameters
// match, or Express will not find your templates
var h4e = require('h4e')
  , express = require('express')
  , app = express()
  , h4eRender;

h4eRender = h4e.setup({ extension: 'mustache'
                      , baseDir: 'templates'
                      , toCompile: ['website', 'forum'] });

app.engine('mustache', h4eRender);
app.set('view engine', 'mustache');
app.set('views', 'templates');

// You're done
```

Partial support is a breeze, you can just reference the file holding the partial, like this:

* `./templates/website/hello.mustache` contains `Hello {{planet}} ! {{>website/description}}`
* The partial `./templates/website/description.mustache` contains `You are {{color}}`

Your request handler will be:

```javascript
app.get('/test', function (req, res, next) {
  var values = { planet: 'World', color: 'blue' };

  // Renders 'Hello World ! You are blue'
  res.render( 'website/hello', { values: values } );
});

```

### That's not enough, I want layouts!
Of course, who doesn't? So now you cannot directly reference the partial filename, but you can do something like this:

* `./templates/website/layout.mustache` contains `Header <b>{{>content}}</b> Footer`
* `./templates/website/pages/index.mustache` contains `Yo {{animal}}, this is the homepage`
* `./templates/website/pages/h4e.mustache` contains `This is {{adjective}} !`

Then your request handlers need to be:

```javascript
app.get('/index', function (req, res, next) {
  var values = { animal: 'dawg' }
    , partials = { content: '{{>website/pages/index}}' }   // Partial content is directly replaced
                                                           // by a reference to the partial holding
                                                          // the page contents: website/pages/index
    ;

  // Renders 'Header <b>Yo dawg, this is the homepage</b> Footer'
  res.render( 'website/layout', { values: values, partials: partials } );
});

app.get('/whatish4e', function (req, res, next) {
  var values = { adjective: 'awesome' }
    , partials = { content: '{{>website/pages/h4e}}' }
    ;

  // Renders 'Header <b>This is awesome !</b> Footer'
  res.render( 'website/layout', { values: values, partials: partials } );
});
```

### I want to use it directly, without Express!
You sure want lots of different things, but that's OK. Set it up without passing a reference to Express, like this:

```javascript
var h4e = require('h4e');

h4e.setup({ extension: 'mustache'
          , baseDir: 'templates'
          , toCompile: ['emails', 'messages'] });
// Rest of Express code here
```

So now you want to send a welcome email. Let's assume:
* `./templates/emails/welcome.mustache` contains `Hello {{username}} ! Welcome to our service !`

```javascript
var values = { username: 'Grafitti' }
  , emailBody = h4e.render('emails/welcome', { values: values });

// emailBody is 'Hello Grafitti ! Welcome to our service !'
```

As you can see, very similar to Express' `res.render`, you can use partials and layouts too.


### I want to directly render strings!
Allright allright, you can do that too.

```javascript
var values = { username: 'Grafitti', species: 'cat' }
  , emailBody = h4e.render('Hello {{username}} ! You are a {{species}}', { values: values });

// emailBody is 'Hello Grafitti ! You are a cat !'
```
